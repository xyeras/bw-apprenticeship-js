// === Create a simple calculator app ===
// 1. On your web page, add a button that triggers a confirm
// asking the user if they would like to calculate two numbers
// 2. if they confirm it should then trigger a prompt
// that asks if they would like to 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply' or 'divide' the two values
// then trigger prompts that asks for the number values
// And finally an alert that lets the user know the result of their values
// Create a js-challenge-three.html and js-challenge-three.js file and submit to github when you are done
// Aside: Create separate functions to run different tasks. And feel free to make your code as dynamic and efficient as you see fit
